# ToDoListNew

A simple **ToDoList** application written in Java for creating and editing *Tasks*.

It is user friendly with a number of features. The current version is console based but we plan to add a GUI in upcoming version. 
```

(1) Show Task List (by date or project)
(2) Add New Task  
(3) Edit Task (update, mark as done, remove)
(4) Save
(5) Quit
```
